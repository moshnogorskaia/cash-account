# Frontend Assignment

Welcome to the frontend assignment! This project is designed to showcase your skills in building a modern web application's user interface and handling client-side state.

## Task Requirements

Your task is to implement the following user story to rename the broker portfolio. Our design team is on their annual offsite, so we don't have a design for this user story. Feel free to use your creativity and best judgment to create an outstanding interface.

The expected time to spend on this task is around 2 hours.

## User Story: Rename Portfolio

As a user, I want to rename my portfolio so that I can easily identify it among my other broker portfolios.

### Acceptance criteria

1. There should be a way for the user to edit the portfolio name.

2. The new name should be saved and reflected in the UI (using client-side state only).

3. The user interaction should be covered by tests.

4. The backend team would also love your input! Please include a GraphQL schema proposal for the mutation they'll need to implement.

We look forward to seeing your work. Good luck! ðŸš€
